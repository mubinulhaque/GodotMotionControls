# Godot Motion Controls
This repository utilises the sensor class of SDL to output the gyro and accelerometer readings of any connected controllers.

## Contents
* An example Godot project (`demo/`)
* godot-cpp as a submodule (`godot-cpp/`)

## Usage
The module is currently stored in `demo/bin` but this may change when a stable build is released. If you want to use the latest development build, copy the bin folder to the root of your Godot 4 project. Note that this only works Godot 4.1.x projects and any other versions of Godot have not been tested.
